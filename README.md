## Project Details
### Details
Implementation of the Rendezvous condition of Operation Systems into Code. Rendezvous is a planned meeting of two or more parts at a specific time and moment, at the same place. For this project, the parts that should meet are the Gas Station Attendant and the Motor. First, all the attendants and motors are synced, so they start at the same conditions. Each motor has to find available (non-blocked) attendants, to fill its tank. Rendezvous will happen when a the empty-tank Motors are able to find available Attendants.
